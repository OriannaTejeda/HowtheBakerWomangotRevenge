            <p>The nights in the valley were long, dreadful even. Mary Ann Elizabeth worked the night shift as a part-time janitor. She needed money more than anything to feed her three sons and her eldest, her daughter. She also worked mornings at the bakery. It was the same bakery no one trusted because information had leeked that they gave poision to unliked customers. "It's just eight to noon," She'd tell herself when times in the bakery had gotten tough. She woke up like an early bird, and her daughter, (the only person person in their family) greeted her with mush-tasting pancakes that were over cooked, and eggs from their one dying chicken. "Have breafast now or never," her daughter warned. "Shela doesn't produce like she used to."
            <p> At exacly seven forty five she had to be at work. It's not like she did anything important until eight, mostly just got a simple "hello" from her boss. Her three sons often came to the bakery, and talked as they sat on the oven and sometimes, but rarely, helped with the bread. They didn't knead the dough or help surve or cut the bread, but sometimes she justed liked the way they'd thought of her and came to the bakery. But today, like everday she arrived at the town square in hopes of cleaning it for a cheap penny, but found someone else had already taken her supplies and was cleaning the stands. She walked up to the man currently doing her job, and tapped his shoulder. 
            "Hey! It's Baker Elizabeth, what are you doing here?" Her brows furrowed. "This is my job." He was kidding. She'd gotten this job. This was her job. Right? "Didn't the boss tell you, you're fired." Elizabeth gasped. She took a broom and started beating the man with it. He ran all around the valley town square like he had fire ants in his pants. 
            Everyone in town square watched as Baker Elizabeth chased some man no one knew around. Eventually, he ran out of town square, and hide in the alleyway. And he was save there. Untill the bees found him. Which caused him to run out of hiding and back into Baker Elizabeth's view. Why was she still chasing this man? Well, she needed answers. Like when did the boss fire her? And had she been showing up for shiftings she hadn't been getting paid for? "Where are you?" Baker Elizabeth called out. The man jumped out of hididng, jumping down on her with a broomstick caught on fire. "HIYA!" He screamed as the fire burnt her arm. "I just need answers," He shook his head. "Why did you chase me to the moutain, then?" "I needed to ask you something," Elizabeth said.
            "You know, you've been working almost two years without pay. They fired you two years and half. But they finally deiced to replace you. It's best you go, now. Don't want to get fired." He was talking about himself. Of course. Elizabeth still had the earnings from the bakery, so she bought to sacks of food and milk, and a new chicken. "Your name is Shela Junior. Don't be as unproductive as your mother, Shela Junior." When Mary Ann Elizabeth Dallis Pocker came home late, and her sons were already sitting at the table with a nice chicken dinner. "Sorry mom. Shela's gone. You didn't come home and bring all the freshest food like you promised, and the boys were hungry. She's gone for good." Elizabeth gasped. "You killed our chicken?" Her daughter, Margot Betteny Poker chuckled. "No! I traded her for food. The trader didn't know she was old and hadn't produced in weeks, so I got an offer for her as if she were a new chicken!"
            Elizabeth smiled. She tugged on the leash leading to outside, and a smaller chicken, much like their previous one walked in. "Oh.my---a new chicken!?! How did you afford that?" Elizabeth smirked. "I knew that janitor job didn't help pay the bills." "I actually got fired...." Margot froze. "Oh, I'm so sorry." "I got fired.....two years ago. They just deducted my pay and I didn't notice," The youngest boy, Athur, who'd heard everything finally joined the conversation.
            <h3>Part Two</h3>
            <p> Elizabeth Baker was poor. They had to sell the house to keep up Margot's college debt, and the lived out in the street. The youngest died two years ealier. Now, three years had passed and Mary Ann Elizabeth Dallis Poker was souless. Two sons remained, her daughter was suffering on her own, and the family was falling apart. She was still a baker. Sometimes she had to steal food from the bakery to feed herself and her children. One day, she was kneeding the dough to make a fresh loaf of bread when someone she hadn't seen in forever showed up in the dirty kitchen. "Hey," the janitor who took her job said. 
            "What are you doing here? Are you here to take this job from me too? Let me guess, I was fired two or three years ago?" The janitor shook his head. "Not yet," he claimed. "But I do know you struggle." Elizabeth frowned. "And? Talk fast or I'll throw you in the oven with this loaf of bread." He nodded. 
            "I have a cure for you," She gave him a confused look. "There's no cure for homelessness. You make it sound like a diesease." He smirked. "Not even if I give you a home, and food, and even your own bakery?" Elizabeth gasped, then frowned again. After lossing her son, she had no hope for change. "This better not be a trick," He nodded. "It's not."
            <p> Turns out the Bakery was real, and the money, and the food promise. But it wasn't luxury. They moved into the house, and it was old and used. But it was a home. Better then "house-hoping", or living on the road or just living in the bakery's storage. Mary Ann Elizabeth Dallis Poker deiced she didn't what to be known through out the valley as the "poor baker" who lived a sad life with two sons above ground and one burried. She dieced that it was too late to change her status, and she'd always be poor. The first person who deserved to feel her "change" was her old boss. All it took was a little bit of poinois in the bread. And many years of prison to pay for it. 
            <p> Seven years of prison later, she finally completed her mission. She'd gotten her revenge.
